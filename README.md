## Description

This app is my submission for the Fetch - iOS Coding Challenge. It displays a list of desserts from the [themealdb](https://themealdb.com/api.php) and also shows the instructions for making each dessert. The app was built in SwiftUI and utilizes the MVVM architecture. Thanks for the fun coding challenge!
